## Building Todoist Clone from Scratch Using React (Custom Hooks, Context) & Firebase NOSQL Database nicknamed GrindStone

This application is a case study for myself to understand how to create a web app using React and the NoSQL database Firebase. It employs React components, hooks, state, context and will eventually use a testing library to test the app as well as adding accessibility to the React components. This web app is part of a tutorial by Karl Hadwen located here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT3j87FMR6M&list=WL&index=39 I have plans on adding my own creations and components as well as new features on my own in the future. I nicknamed this project GrindStone. This to do list app will help users keep their nose to the grindstone and accomplish their tasks!
